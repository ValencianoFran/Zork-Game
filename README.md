Hello Zork!

I did a new Zork and begin do commits since the commit "NEW ZORK_Created rooms and player" because 
the last one had a very bad structure.

CONTROLS:
You can use these commands:
					<go direction, look direction , open/close direction, help and quit>
									OR
					<g direction, l direction, o direction, c direction>
With these directions: 
						<north, south, east, west, up, down> 
									OR
						<n, s, e, w, u, d>
						
Default action is 'go' if you only introduce the direction.\n"

The Curse of the lost will be set in sea and islands. 
The protagonist is shipwrecked and we do not know his history. 
Our main objective will be leave the area of islands, but there is a problem, the sea is full of sharks 
and we have no way of killing them, so we must explore the map to find a way to eliminate them.

I did commits on the deleted Zork from different dispositives and they have another author name,
but they all are done by me.
